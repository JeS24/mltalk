	<b>Title</b>: Near Real-Time Incremental Learning for Object Detection at the Edge <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00781">[arXiv]</a><br><br>	
	<b>Abstract</b>: One of the most interesting areas for application of object detection techniques is Internet of Things (IoT) or in a nutshell, "Edge Computing devices". Most of current research is focussed on tuning and compressing networks that can be run with limited resources on such devices, but this usually takes hours of training time. As such, a crucial component for AI on the edge has to be real-time Incremental Learning (IL) of new object classes. In this talk, the paper I will be presenting, explores this avenue and combats the problem of Catastrophic Forgetting (CF), by introducing a novel one-stage deep object detection algorithm, that incorporates some insights from the Learning without Forgetting (LwF) Knowledge Distillation technique. Additionally, the authors have designed an automated training dataset construction pipeline for the new object class, that ensures that the inference capability of the edge device is near real-time.<br>

	<h2>Talk 1</h2> 
        <br><br>
        <b>Speaker</b>: Danush Shekar <br><br>
	<b>Date/Time</b>: Friday, Jan 1st, 2021| 7:00 PM <br><br>
	<b>Title</b>: Fooling automated surveillance cameras: adversarial patches to attack person detection <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08653.pdf">[arXiv]</a><br><br>	
	<b>Abstract</b>: We have all seen machine learning algorithms gaining widespread attention in multiple industries. Surveillance and security is one such area where machine learning has applications in. Recent research papers have been focussing on finding image patches for such algorithms which cause say, a classifier, to ignore the said object. The arXiv paper I will be presenting is one such example, wherein the authors present an approach to generate adversarial image patches that one can wear or hold to be hidden from a person-detection classifier. <br>
